Fix Valkyrie Text
Add new image-related and colors-related functions
Add new enum and flags, and use them instead of raw values
Remove some comments in structures thanks to enum and flags
Update some values/comments based on BWAPI data
Remove "using" in middle of files (unsafe use for this keyword)
Add new enumeration files (like SpriteId.h or SoundId.h)
Fixed function getMaxHpInGame (wasn't always doing what it was supposed to do)
