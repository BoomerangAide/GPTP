Update 2:

Improving DatLoad for researchers (though some features will be useful for ordinary modders)
Adding more infos on BinDlg in structures.h (since I met this in assembly)
Fixing an error in SoundId.h
Re-adding helpers in tech_target_check.cpp (it's better to not have hooks rely too much on others, and it will remains compatible anyways.
Infestation hook: Identified DatLoad arrays and others things
Infestation hook: infesting unit side
Adding something in SoundId.h: namespace DeathSoundId { const u16 deathSoundIdList[UnitId::None+1][2]; }
	This is meant to be used by something like 
	scbw::playSound(
		scbw::randBetween(
			DeathSoundId::deathSoundIdList[unit->id][0],
			DeathSoundId::deathSoundIdList[unit->id][1]
		);
	);
	to play a random death sound, according to the ones used in Iscript.bin.
Adding IconId enum (because it's used in buttonset hook)
**Adding buttonsets hook and features related to it.**

**Creations of files helpfunc.h and helpfunc.cpp**
	Those are not supposed to be used directly.
	It's an attempt to extract some assembly functions I needed a better understanding of,
	converting them into C/C++ so they are more readable.
	I may have lost or missed some things on the way (especially things stored in the stack -_-')
	and one of my common cause of crash is bad management of wrappers code, so you probably would
	have to make some research and fixes to have theses functions useable (unless I'm being really
	pessimistic)

[Planned] 
 * Research on various known or unknown functions to have better knowledge on how StarCraft do things.

-------------------------

Update "1st-big-update" :

Fix Valkyrie Text
Add new image-related and colors-related functions
Add new enum and flags, and use them instead of raw values
Remove some comments in structures thanks to enum and flags
Update some values/comments based on BWAPI data
Remove "using" in middle of files (unsafe use for this keyword)
Add new enumeration files (like SpriteId.h or SoundId.h)
Fixed function getMaxHpInGame (wasn't always doing what it was supposed to do)
Add a few lines in existing enums (mainly "None" entries). 
Adding the combined UnitMovement flag for hover units and using it
Updated the .vcproj file (though I'm not sure if this is enough to allow a fully downloaded source to work immediately)
Added a different message than the "incorrect starcraft version" message for StarEdit.
**Added the new hook files infestation.h, infestation.cpp and infestation_inject.cpp**
