-----------

Version 5.900:

- Moving to Visual Studio 2019.This is mainly about project and solution files, the code files should remain backward compatible, though I won't check and just be careful

- scbw\structures.h
	- Fixed a signed/unsigned mistake in a type
	- Added information on how "fastcall" worked compared to injected/helper functions
- scbw\scbwdata.h
	- added PortraitId and WeaponIconId confirmed entries for dat files
	- removed tempUnitsListArraysCountsList as it was just a variation of another variable that should be used as such
	- added some information on fontBase (not really useful yet, but soon...)
	- added format strings used by the printf implementation of Starcraft
- graphics folder:
	- added drawDottedLine2 and drawDottedEllipse2 functions to alternate the drawn color between 2 colors
- hooks\interface\btns_cond files:
	- no longer using local constants, things fixed accordingly

- hooks\interface\buttonsets files:
	- now BUTTON_STATE enum properly used
	- some fixes and changes to make it easier to use
	- now comment by default getButtonSetPatch_For_Sub4591D0 from inject since it's either this one or the 591D0 that matter.
- hooks\recv_commands\CMDRECV_Build files:
	- added function cmdRECV_PlaceBuildingOrder (formerly known as function_0048DE70) and helpers needed for it
- SCBW\structures\CUnit hooks:
	- added the StoredUnit structure and updated code accordingly

	- Added 3 more hooked functions
	- Gave function 6FB40 its proper name (getSelectedUnitsAtPoint) and arguments
	- Special CallToUnit_IsStandardAndMovable_Wrapper in inject file to mod the use
	  of unit_IsStandardAndMovable by a function that could not just be hooked
